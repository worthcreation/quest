# Quest: handoff notes (as of build 62, 26 Sep 2026)

## What this is
Browser RPG, Zelda meets EarthBound. One file, `index.html`, on GitHub Pages: https://worthcreation.github.io/quest/
Repo: https://github.com/worthcreation/quest (personal account `worthcreation`).

## The single source of truth
`index.html` is the whole game. It is assembled from split source parts (in `src/` here) with:

    cd src && cat head.html p1.js p2.js p3.js p4.js p6.js p7.js p8.js p9.js p10.js p11.js p12.js p13.js p14.js p5.js > ../index.html

Note the order: p5.js goes LAST (it has drawItemIcon, resize, startup). If the split parts are ever lost,
the game can be re-split from index.html (each part starts with a comment banner); but better: commit `src/`,
`tests/` and `tools/` to the repo so the next chat can pick them up.

Ship step (every build): download index.html, then
    mv ~/Downloads/index.html ~/quest/index.html && cd ~/quest && git add . && git commit -m "Build N: ..." && git push

## File map
- head.html   HTML, CSS, touch buttons (#pad, #act, #jump, #dash(A), #eat(S), #slotd(D), #throw(swap), #fire, #menubtn)

- p5.js       drawItemIcon, drawItems, enemies drawing, text layout (layoutTexts), resize, boot   (LAST in the cat)
- p6.js       interact(), farming (PATCH levels), findInteractable, Pip guide + story lines, cutscenes (intro/dusk/abduct/sword), river quest, pack menu, save/load, breakBarrier
- p7.js       drawing: ground, solids, hero (drawHero), HUD (drawHUD), menu screens, tips, BUILD constant

- p9.js       arena mode (?arena): ARENA_ZONES on real screens, arenaKit
- p10.js      puzzle mode (?puzzle): PUZZLES list, portals, records in localStorage 'quest-puzzles'
- p11.js      drawn hero model (arena only / &model): POSES, drawHeroModel, pose sheet (mirror in arena glade)
- p12.js      wind ledges, landing shadow, ravines drawing, Wick's jetty (placeDock/drawJetty), shack drawing
- p13.js      camp building & crafting (RAW, RECIPES, craft mat), lean-to interior, old jetty, STORY flags
- p14.js      food ranges & crop levels (FOOD, cropLevel, farmLevel, eatFood, CROP_PERK), mushroom glow, quick slots (SLOT_KEYS, useSlot, drawSlotBar),
              skills (SKILLS, skillUse, skillLevel, setSkillLevel, SKILL_COLOR), acorn spread/homing (acornSpread, steerAcorn)

## Conventions that matter
- Everything is in fractions of the screen (fx, fy) at gen time; UNIT = one tile in px (H/14 landscape). Anything that must be
  jumpable/hoppable is laid out in TILES at enterScene (stepping stones, ravine rock columns, ledges, ravines on the crags).
- Runtime per-screen state lives in RT[id] = {deadAt, items, pulled(Set), flags}. Barriers: solids with `bar`; broken when
  rt.flags[bar] is true (breakBarrier). showFlag: solid appears only when rt.flags[showFlag] (camp pieces).
- Save format v16. Settings in localStorage 'quest-settings'. Three save slots.
- Test modes share ALL gameplay code. ARENA/PUZZLE only add a hub screen, a kit, and a few System items. Keep it that way.
- Text: say(text, x, y, {key, life, tip, color}). key 'pip'/'npc' = speech (holds titles). tips go to the menu marquee only.
  Prompts "F to ..." are replaced by the action ring + label (findInteractable). Text boxes are placed once and fixed (t.pos).
- Pip: pipSay(key, text, at, sight) says once per key, walks to `at` and waits there until you come over.
- Story flags: inv.story = STORY.garden(1) -> tocamp(2) -> gather(3) -> adventure(4). campBuilt('fire'|'tent'|'bench').
- Keys: arrows move, Space jump, F act/weapon, R swap (hold = wheel), A/S/D quick slots, E fire, M menu.
- Skills (build 62): inv.skill[id] = {n (uses), hits, lvl}; progress = n + 2*hits crosses SKILLS[id].steps (4 levels);
  each step says SKILLS[id].lines[lvl-1] once, in SKILL_COLOR '#c9a2ff', key 'skill'. Never show numbers. Only 'acorn' is
  wired: skillUse('acorn') in launch(), skillUse('acorn', true) on an enemy hit in updateShots(). sword/dodge/farm tables
  exist with lines but nothing calls them yet. Acorns: spread ACORN_SPREAD[lvl] degrees, homing ACORN_HOME[lvl] rad/s
  toward the nearest hittable enemy inside a 36 degree cone within 4+lvl tiles. Arena System item "Acorn practice" cycles
  the level for testing (setSkillLevel). Old saves get inv.skill lazily; save format still v16.
- Never use pressure plates language: woods puzzles are cracked keystones (throw a rock), buried rocks (stomp to knock loose,
  then rock and heave), brambles (thrown rock), the gremlin burrow (thrown rock).

## Testing (headless, node)
`tests/*.js` eval index.html with a fake canvas/audio (see the top of t21.js). Run from /tmp with index.html at
/mnt/user-data/outputs/index.html (or edit the path). Useful ones:
- t21 full game tour to the rescue  - t57 garden/robin lesson  - t56 opening + camp build  - t59 twilight/forest/hole
- t42 stepping stones (12 crossings) - t44 rock columns + crags - t51/t52 wind sets & rides - t60 food levels/gusts/HUD
- t61 quick slots + fixed text - t62 acorn skill (hit rates by level, level-up once, save round trip) - t43 puzzle mode (11 stones) - t47 arena (4 zones) - t33 text overlap - t41 legibility
- tools/overlap.js: 300 worlds, expects "overlaps 0". tools/shot.js renders PNGs with @napi-rs/canvas (npm i in tools/); SKILL=1 renders the level-up line.
Some older tests (t15, t32, t38, t27) are stale after redesigns.

## Where things are (world)
Camp (lean-to, fire ring, bench, 6 patches, mushroom) north of the glade (start). Meadow (Pip's garden, robin) west of glade;
riverbank north of meadow (old jetty south bank; Wick's shack + jetty far bank; ford west). Woods w1..w3 east of glade
(sword at w3, sinkhole to caves). Mountain path f1..f7 south (wind sets of three, ledges, rock columns, tortoise at f7),
High Crags peak1..3 east of f7 (unlocked after the tortoise). Foothill farm west of f1. Marsh/hollow/swamp/caves as before.

## Balance / pending ideas
- Charger horn only from 2 chargers; ironwood bottleneck (3 recipes want 10); Warden enrage threshold 9 (consider 12).
- Drawn hero is shelved (arena + &model only) until reviewed.
- Ideas parked: chapter 2 dungeon under the swamp shrine, seasons, gremlin raids on the farm, rope traversal, music reacting to combo,
  new game+, co-op; unbuilt monsters (Bog Bellower, Moss Golem, Thornback boar, Nettle Sprite, Ash Wraith, Gremlin Chief,
  Mountain Roc (foreshadowed at the summit), Wind Wisp, Salamander, The Sleeper).

## Next task (suggested)
Wire the other skills through the same table: skillUse('sword') per swing and ('sword', true) per hit in p4 combat,
skillUse('dodge', true) when a dodge avoids a hit (state.dodged), skillUse('farm') per plant/harvest. Then give each
level a small effect: sword combo window, dodge cooldown, crop speed. Keep levels invisible and the lines rare.
